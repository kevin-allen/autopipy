# autopipy

This is the documentation for the python package autopipy. This package can be used to perform data analysis of behavioral experiment using the **AutoPI task**.

If you want to use autopipy to do pose estimation with deeplabcut network, pose estimation will be much faster if you install a version of tensorflow/deeplabcut with GPU support. Of course you will also need a computer with a decent GPU. See the [deeplabcut documentation](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut) for more information.
