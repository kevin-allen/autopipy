# autopipy

This is a python package to analyze the data we collected on the AutoPI task.

It relies on several python packages (opencv, deeplabcut, etc). 

The aim is to have all our code to anayse our autopy data sets within a single development environment (python/jupyter lab).

The variables extracted from each trial can be double-checked by generating a figure or video for the trial.

Find the source code on [github](https://github.com/kevin-allen/autopipy).

The documentation is in the [docs](https://github.com/kevin-allen/autopipy/tree/master/docs/main.md) directory.
