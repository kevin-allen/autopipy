# autopipy

This is a python package to analyze the data we collected on the AutoPI task.

I decided to write this package to make it possible to use all the tool we need (opencv, deeplabcut, pytorch, etc) without having to change programming environment (from R to python).

Find the source code on [github](https://github.com/kevin-allen/autopipy).

The documentation is in the [docs directory](https://github.com/kevin-allen/autopipy/docs/main.md).
