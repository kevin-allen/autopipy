# autopipy

This is a python package to analyze the data we collected on the AutoPI task.

It relies on several python packages (opencv, deeplabcut, etc). 
I wanted to be able to create videos using opencv to test the quality of the feature extraction of trials.

Find the source code on [github](https://github.com/kevin-allen/autopipy).

The documentation is in the [docs](https://github.com/kevin-allen/autopipy/tree/master/docs/main.md) directory.
